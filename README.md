The Women in Computing Archive is a digital platform designed to commemorate and highlight the contributions of women in the history of computer science. This issue is particularly important because many pioneering women in the field have been overlooked, and their stories remain largely unknown to the public. By creating this archive, we aim to bridge this gap, making these achievements more accessible and inspiring to future generations.
